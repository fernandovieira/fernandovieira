### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fernando and I'm a Software Engineer Java is my main language and I am trying to figure out how to express on this digital era.

I'm eager to learn, ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Cojure and I  got a lot productive using emacs.

Perhaps some day I will be confident to contribute on a large library but by now I consider myself a truly learner. :)
